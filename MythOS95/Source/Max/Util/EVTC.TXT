                    *** IFF Event Compiler Grammar ***

    This is the compiler for the Max event library's IFF format trigger
 file.


 Note: Assembly style comments  ';' to <end-of-line>

 <event>        := 'event' <id> '{' <trigger> '}'
 <trigger>      := '[' <constraint> * ']'
 <constraint>   := <key> | <mouseb> | <mousepos> | <mouserange>
 <key>          := 'key' <expr>
 <mouseb>       := 'mouseb' <expr>
 <mousepos>     := 'mousepos' <expr> <expr>
 <mouserange>   := 'mouserange' <expr> <expr>

 <expr> maps to a standard arithmetic rule set for +, -, *, / with longs

 <id> maps to a standard C-style identifier.

 The numbers in an <expr> can be character constants with C-style '?'
 and hex numbers may begin with 0x.
