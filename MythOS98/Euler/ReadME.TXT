 DESCRIPTION

 This library provides basic classes for vectors, points, and matricies
 providing arithimetic and affine operations.  Its primary use is for
 2D and 3D graphics, but support for additional numerical methods will be
 added as required.


 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NOTES

 Basic implementation of 2D and 3D vectors, points, and matricies with
 structure in place to implement AMD 3DNow versions.
