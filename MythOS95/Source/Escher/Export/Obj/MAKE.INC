#
#      This standard make include file is setup for compling with Watcom
#      version 10.0 and MASM 6.11.
#
#      It assumes that INCPATH is setup to be a PATH-style variable of
#      include paths, DEBUG is set to NO, ASSERT, or YES for debug
#      compilation, and CALLCONV is set to REGISTER if register calling
#      convention should be used instead of STACK.
#
#      Also, the first target should be defined BEFORE this include.
#
#      The dependancy 'setstden' sets up the PATH and INCLUDE environment
#      variables to include path to include the additional directories
#      in INCPATH, which is used by MASM and Watcom.
